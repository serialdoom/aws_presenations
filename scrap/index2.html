                        I will at least *try* to be a little provocative and claim that the allure of Big Data is a fetish of the times, that the fear of and intimidation by Big Data is a byproduct of misinformation and really try to convince you that:
                        -big data is not a thing - one can talk as specifically about big data as about making dinner
                        -big data is not new - it's been around since (or even before) the beginning of the digital age
                        (e.g. aviation industry - data sets have been growing ever since they were created)

                         -And its hype is growing because there's just so much more of it now, in any field. 
                                -But it's not that there's more of it - more people have access to it:
                                -non-specialists have access to it

                        would like to talk about things that I have discovered  through my experience
                        -3 key problems (volume, velocity, variety) manifested over 3 key constraings (hardware, software, analysis)
                        -otherwise it's the same!
                        -and people have historically been after more data - except now we call it 'Big' and it's scary
                                (although, granted, now we have access to data that we may have not been collecting actively or purposefully. In other words, studies are now often retrospective, which changes things *slightly* (conceptually AND statistically) - but as I said I'm being extra provocative here!)

                                -When we talk about big data typically we are referring data that is either high-dimensional and/or >>GB in size when zipped(!)

                                -need both space and hardware that will support input/output - multiple users accessing data, transferring it around and writing out data, simultaneously.
                                (this is a real problem - bring up WTCHG)

                                Where do you store it?
                                -who will need to access it? obviously we can't know this definitely but it's a legitimate concern, especially as everything becomes more and more interdisciplinary. 
                                -people access to the same server? or should it be online? Is it even downloadable? Need an ftp service? How long would it take to transfer files?
                                -security? Could you solve your storage problem on the cloud?
                                ... native american example
                                
                                -Looking ahead, this is a solvable problem.

                                -how do you store it? All in one blob? 
                                -relational or non-relational: many files, many directories?
                                -how many people will need to access at any one time?
                                -will they need to access all of it or should it very be straightforward to pull out sub-chunks?
                                - leq 2K files/directory
                                -format? Json - great for web design but would be a really bad idea for genomic data for instance: in my current project I use genomic data for 5000 individuals at 1M DNA positions.
                                Not only do I know what their DNA is, but how confidently it was obtained in the lab (so for each person I have 1M of these scores too), I have a bunch of measurements for specific genes that I am interested, their gender, whether they smoke, their age and dietery habits. 
                                Storing this in json format - I have not calculated but would argue with conviction - is impossible.)
                                -again, who will need to use it? What software do they use? What analysis will they perform?
                                -csv vs vcf vs plain text vs json

                                -should always be such that it allows for parallelisation of jobs on cluster

                                -of course it's not just accessing and managing but writing out afterwards as well...

                                -this is a solvable problem.

                            this is not just a big data issue
                            1. which software?
                            1b. Need to consider which analyses we will carry out - to decide on choice of software
                            (millions of tweets - some NLP)
                            (python: handling the data - good for dealing with text)
                            (python: basic NLP)
                            (c++: NLP using more stophisticated stat tools (e.g. HMM, a bayesian approach?) )
                            (R or matlab  to summarise results)
                            (and then/or perhaps html, css, javascript to read those into a browser)
                            2. ulitmately it comes down to: speed vs memory vs and who the user is

                            All this while:
                            2b. Construct a pipeline - this of the order/sequence of jobs
                            3. and whether you're working with other people (this is not a big data problem only)
                            4. and whether it's on a cluster

                            -schematic of a pipeline - what are the different pieces of software, how do they work together
                            all the various bits of software that are involved
                            -don't mention a pipeline

                                -b) this plot is poor - we'd need a time series - data is on different time zones!
                                -c) finding associations and patterns is key to having that insight
